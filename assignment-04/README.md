I went to http://www2.obamaforillinois.com/splash.php where Barrack Obama created a website for support for him running as Senator for Illinois in 2004. The website was very simplistic, but well organized with it's layout, links and images. The site no longer exists because he succesfully became a Senator, and later the U.S. president.
Using the GIT Module, I've found it easier for some things, but having the navigation layout be so much different than Atom, I need to spend more time figuring it out. I'm not sure if it can let me view HTML files as a preview of the actual browser display. I personally prefer an application that will allow the huge range of options from dropdown lists and from right-clicking while everything else is visually easy to look at and not overrun with file branches.
