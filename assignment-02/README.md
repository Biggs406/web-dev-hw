<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
<h2>Taylor Beighle</h2>
<p>I chose to take this class because I enjoy learning the creative side of programming when it's not monotonous; and I need to have a broad understanding of different programming languages and their uses to be an electrical engineer.</p>
<ol>
  <li>I hope to learn how to design a web page that has flowing animations when scrolling.</li>
  <li>I also hope to learn new ways to make an attractive website that isn't based on some stock website format, such as Wix.</li>
  <li>The final thing(s) I hope to learn in this class is new approaches that designers can take to make a range of unique websites, and not just focus on things like math algorithms that can be copied and pasted from code other developers have uploaded as freeware on the Internet. I've already taken a class that was > 50% based on coding math algorithms. It's not necessary when websites like Symbolab already exist!</li>
