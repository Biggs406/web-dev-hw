   "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin</h2></div></a></main><br><br><br>
   
<div class="first-line" ><p>
   There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold</p><p class="b">
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>
When she gets there she knows&#44; if the stores are all closed<br>
With a word she can get what she came for.<br>
Ooh&#44; ooh&#44; and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
<div class="first-line"><p>
   There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure<br></p><p class="b">
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.<br>
In a tree by the brook&#44; there's a songbird who sings&#44;<br>
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
<div class="first-line"><p>
Ooh&#44; it makes me wonder&#44;<br></p><p class="b">
Ooh&#44; it makes me wonder.
<div class="first-line"><p>
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west&#44;<br></p><p class="b">
And my spirit is crying for leaving.<br>
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees&#44;<br>
And the voices of those who stand looking.<br><br>
<div class="first-line"><p>
Ooh&#44; it makes me wonder&#44;<br></p><p class="b">
Ooh&#44; it really makes me wonder.
<div class="first-line"><p>
And it's whispered that soon&#44; if we all call the tune&#44;<br></p><p class="b">
Then the piper will lead us to reason.<br>
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long&#44;<br>
And the forests will echo with laughter.
<div class="first-line"><p>
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow&#44; don't be alarmed now&#44;<br></p><p class="b">
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.<br>
Yes&#44; there are two paths you can go by&#44; but in the long run<br>
There's still time to change the road you're on.<br>
And it makes me wonder.
<div class="first-line"><p>
Your head is humming and it won't go&#44; in case you don't know&#44;<br></p><p class="b">
The piper's calling you to join him&#44;<br>
Dear lady&#44; can you hear the wind blow&#44; and did you know<br>
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
<div class="first-line"><p>
And as we wind on down the road<br></p><p class="b">
Our shadows taller than our soul.<br>
There walks a lady we all know<br>
Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
How everything still turns to gold.<br>
And if you listen very hard<br>
The tune will come to you at last.<br>
When all are one and one is all<br>
To be a rock and not to roll.<br><br>
<div class="first-line"><p>
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br></p><p class="b">
