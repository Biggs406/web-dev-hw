  <li>Margin is the outer space of an element, while padding is the inner space of an element. In other words, margin is the space outside of an element's border, while padding is the space inside of its border. Borders can be applied to most HTML elements within the body. To make a border around an element, all you need is border-style .</li>

  <li>I actually had an entirely different website design using html pug, but couldn't figure out how to use the compiler and didn't think it met the assignment criteria so I started over after many hours of work. I thought it would be interesting to see how websites like soundcloud work to find music in the database and stream it on a webpage, so I found an open source code that allowed me to edit and access their web player using javascript paired with html and css. I wanted to save the time I lost a little by keeping the layout of the page content more simple than I have been. I included all of the main/meta elements, divs, ids, lists, buttons, nav queries, and linking sheets for the styling. A good amount of the styling is preset from the soundcloud web player, but I edited the organization of all of the elements to my taste. I kept the logo and page title generic for the most part, and customized the album/song that appears when the page is initially loaded. After taking a while to get the page to work, I'm amazed at how much the music player works and what you can find in the database!</li>
